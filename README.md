# Graphite

Nice (and not too efficient) way to find the most optimal line given n out of x points.

This was a part of my report in Higher Level Mathematics in order to gain access to the exam.

Graphite here has 2 meanings:

- First meaning is that graphite is the material used for most drawing on paper.
- The other meaning is that it's a power tool (Graph-ite), the tool of graphs.

The least squares method was intentionally omitted, as it was beyond the scope of our curriculum. In its place, I devised a custom method derived from the mathematical principles we had studied.
